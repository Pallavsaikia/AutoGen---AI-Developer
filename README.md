## üß† Core Concepts

- **Core Adapter**: Abstract base class that defines the interface for all LLM adapters.
- **OpenAI Adapter**: Implementation of the core adapter for OpenAI APIs (e.g., GPT-4, GPT-3.5).
- **DeepSeek Adapter**: Adapter for using DeepSeek's large language models.
- **Orchestration Layer**: Supports custom patterns like sequential reasoning, agent workflows, and tool usage.

## üì¶ Adapters

| Adapter       | Description                            |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| Core Adapter  | Interface and shared logic             |
| OpenAI        | GPT-3.5 / GPT-4 API support            |
| DeepSeek      | DeepSeek-v2 and beyond                 |

Adapters are fully modular. You can extend the system with your own LLM provider or fine-tuned model.

## üõ†Ô∏è Orchestration Patterns (Coming Soon)

The project will support common orchestration approaches such as:

- Task ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí Verify
- Tool-augmented reasoning
- Multi-agent delegation
- Memory-enhanced workflows

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/llm-orchestration-framework.git
